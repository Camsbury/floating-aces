#+TITLE: Floating Aces

* THIS EXTENSION IS IN PROGRESS

* MVP TODO
** initial game started
*** [x] add parsed event to the queue unless it is a comparison, or a show
**** just add new ones incrementally
*** [ ] Maybe the overall render will show EVERYTHING... the deck, the shuffles, the next comparison to resolve, and the event queue
*** [ ] Things can be blocked by a request for order
*** [ ] If blocked, the event isn't dropped from the queue and the user is informed
*** [ ] figure out how to deal with ordering cards (from xndr)
*** [ ] add another event which is prioritizing two uuids

* They just float to the top!
** Getting Started
- M-x ~fa-init~
